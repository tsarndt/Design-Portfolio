							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<article>
								<!--<p>Hey, I'm Tyler - landscape designer, technology nerd and sports enthusiast.</p>
								<p>After receiving my degree from Iowa State University back in 2012 (has it really been that long?), I decided to trade cornfields and combines for palm trees and sunshine and I took off for southern California. Since then I've been working as a landscape designer where I've been learning the ins and outs of the landscape architecture profession.</p>
								<p>During this time, I've been able to work on some pretty cool projects from masterplan streetscape improvements and urban park design, to academic campuses and high-rise luxury tower courtyards. When I'm not in the studio, I can often be found hiking, playing guitar, learning website design, or watching my beloved Minnesota Vikings <b>not</b> win a Super Bowl.</p>
								<p>So that's a little about me. If you have any questions or comments about my work feel free to shoot me a message; I can be reached best by email, LinkedIn, or bat signal... hey, it's worth a shot.</p>-->

								<!--<p>Hey there, I'm Tyler and thank you for visiting my online design portfolio!</p>
								<p>After receiving my degree from Iowa State University back in 2012 (has it really been that long?), I decided to kick off my career in landscape architecture in sunny California. For four years I worked on masterplan streetscape improvements, urban park design, academic campuses and high-rise luxury tower courtyards. In 2015 I discovered a new avenue to use the design skills and software programs I learned in landscape architecture - concert and event management!</p>
								<p>For nearly three years I have played integral roles in the site design and production of large college stadium concerts, country club golf course shows and weekend-long music festivals. These events have given me the chance to work alongside some incredible, hard-working people to provide safe, comfortable environments for concert-goers.</p>
								<p>The crossover of skill sets between landscape architecture and event management has been broader than I would have ever imagined. Within this website you will find an archive of landscape architecture projects that formed the site design, drafting, and computer graphic skills I use every day in event management. If you have any questions or comments about my work feel free to shoot me a message; I can be reached best by email, LinkedIn, or bat signal... hey, it's worth a shot!</p>-->
							
								<p>Hey there, I'm Tyler and thank you for visiting my online design portfolio!</p>
								<p>After receiving my bachelor’s degree from Iowa State University in 2012 (has it really been that long?), I kicked off my landscape architecture career in sunny California. For four years I worked on urban park design, academic campuses, master plan streetscape redevelopments and high-rise luxury tower courtyards. In 2015 I discovered a new avenue to use the design skills and software programs I learned in landscape architecture – website design and front-end application development!</p>
								<p>I took a deep dive into the world of front-end development by hard-coding this very portfolio site with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Since then I have explored additional front-end languages, honed my skills with content management systems, and gained valuable insight into definitive SEO practices. These learning experiences have led to a number of projects including personal websites, online blogs and professional sites for small businesses.</p>
								<p>The crossover of skill sets between landscape architecture and front-end development has been broader than I would have ever imagined.
